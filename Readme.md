## ClubSurvival Halloween Event
A custom plugin for ClubSurvival<ClubNetwork.us.to:25565>'s Halloween event to do some cool things.  

Current features:
* Maybe sends Title on login
* Maybe random blindness effect
 

TODO:
* Random playsound
* Random Bat spawning @ player location.   

Depend:
* PaperMC -- I think it will work on other platforms but its written from the Paper API
